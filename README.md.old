# weather-daemon

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -U pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
weather-daemon --help
```

rough outline - this will be similiar to rss-daemon that already exist


The weather-daemon creates static json file like rss-daemon does at /weather/weather_forecast.json in web root
It polls Google Maps weather api every hour and writes and updates /weather/weather_forecast.json  in web root
api key should read from a config file I will enter later
refer to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/weather

needs systemd service, nginx and maybe haproxy configs too (will provide this when we get there)
